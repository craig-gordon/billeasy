## Visual Recognition

If an adequate 3rd party module exists, implement a system for reading a picture taken of a receipt
and then pulling that data into the server.

## Mobile Port

Port the application to iOS and Android.

## Google/Facebook/Phone Contact List Integration

Allow the Organizer to easily pull friends' phone numbers from an outside source.

## Make it optional for any given Diner's phone # to be known

Perhaps the Organizer is out with people they don't have a phone number for. Implement a solution
to be able to account for this situation.

## Flesh out the discount options

They are not fully implemented right now -- allow users to account for discounts applied to
individual items, individual diners, or entire meals, in both flat and percentage forms.

## Include more Account customization options

Allow users to upload a profile picture or store more information about themselves.
