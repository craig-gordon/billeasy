## Usage

A large group is wrapping up a meal at a restaurant. The most motivated person (the Organizer) opens the
main page of BillEasy, searches for the restaurant in a Google Maps view, and chooses the items on the
group's receipt from the list of menu items that pops up on the page. The Organizer also enters the phone
number of every diner in the group. Each diner will receive a link that allows them to choose which receipt
items they partook in. When all diners have submitted, the Organizer will be shown the share of the bill
each diner owes, tip and tax included. Each diner can also view their meal history by submitting their
phone number.
